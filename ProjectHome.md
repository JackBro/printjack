The aim of this project is to provide a port monitor and a library that allows configuration of the monitor from within applications.

The printer port monitor can receive raw data from the print spooler, do something with it, and send it on to the printer or elsewhere. Possible uses include printing directly to PDF with or without user intervention. Note that PDF generation requires an external application to do the actual conversion.

There are other open source alternatives out there, mainly
[Redmon](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/redmon/index.htm) and [Redmon EE](http://www.is-foehr.com/).
